# README

The Depot code example from Agile Web Development with Rails 5.1 by Ruby
and Copeland, published by The Pragmatic Programmers.

I'll be using this repo to stay on top of Rails 5 features, since my
professional work is still in Rails 4.

Current Status:

* Rails 5.1.4

* Ruby 2.4.1

* Dec-21-2017 - Initial code development is complete

* Commentary (if any) will be on my [blog](http://www.thecwlzone.com/blog/)
